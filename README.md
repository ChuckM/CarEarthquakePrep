# Preparing for the Big One #

In California we're told to prepare for the large earthquake that
is coming in our future. Since we spend a large amount of time in
our cars, having all these earthquake supplies **at home** doesn't
really help if you are out on the freeway somewhere.

To address that I put together a car kit that I could carry in my
car all of the time. The purpose of the car kit is to give me
enough supplies to get back home (assuming I'll walk there), and
then once I'm at home I've got my earthquake supplies there to
live on while I'm waiting for my FEEMA trailer :-). 

I have mentioned it and people ask me to provide the list so 
here it is. The benefit here is also that people are welcome
to submit PRs against this list if you see ways to improve it.

The goal is to be safe, reduce the load on first responders by
taking care of as much as we can by ourselves, and to get though
the immediate crisis so that we can get to work on the rebuilding
afterwards.
