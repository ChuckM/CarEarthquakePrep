# Car Go Bag

## Rationale

This is my emergency supplies bag for the car. It has evolved over the
years based on available technology and what we have observed to be the
challenges which face people during and after serious disasters. The
mission requirements for this gear are simple, provide sufficient
equipment to get me and a passenger in my car from where ever we had to
stop in the Bay area back to "home base."

## Assumptions
These assumptions are re-evaluated each time the gear in the bag is
re-evaluated. They are developed by noting conditions of other disasters
both in the US and elsewhere.

* The greatest threat will be earthquakes which damage roads and make car 
  travel difficult or impossible for some period of time.
* Cellular phone service will be spotty or non-existent.
* Power will be off in large areas.
* Medical services will be ad-hoc and first responders will be occupied.
* The mission:
 * If no (or minor) injuries - Stay warm and move under our own power from where we 
   started to home.
 * If significant injuries (can't travel under our own power) - connect with
   first responders to get into the triage pipeline.

## Bag Gear

Gear in the bag and the reasoning behind it. Max bag weight target is
20 lbs. Current bag is an REI Traverse daypack with hydration bladder
support.

### Food

* 3 liter water bladder - This is roughly 1/3 the pack weight budget. One gallon
  bottled water is in the car at all times, replaced biannually. 
* Micropur water purification tablets (20) - 1 tablet per liter provides
  for six refills of the water bladder from questionable water sources.
* Water filtration straw - removes particulates and odd flavors (backup water system)
* US Coast Guard approved food biscuits (10) - (3 KCal/bar) 

### Clothing/Shelter

* High reflectivity emergency blankets (2) - for prevention of shock,
  staying warm at night, and for signalling during the day.
* Rain poncho (10mm PVC) - Bright yellow rain poncho provide some protection
  from rain and a makeshift cover for sleeping under if necessary.
* T-shirts (2)  - vacuum packed (low volume) cotton t-shirts for use as
  bandages, or replacement clothes if needed.
* Work gloves with leather protection - for protecting hands from broken
  glass, and other hazards.
* Headband/sweatband to keep sweat out of the eyes.
* 3M 6200 series half mask respirator - P100 filters for protecting
  against dust hazards and other fumes while walking.

### Medical

* REI  Lacerations and bandages First Aid kit - Basic first aid, 
  ACE bandages (sprains), adhesive bandages (cuts), steri-strips (wound closure),
  gauze bandages, medical tape, specific drugs: aspirin, acetaminophen,
  ibuprofen, imodium, claritin (allergy), and antacid.
* StaphAseptic -  antibacterial and topical anesthetic cream. 
* Instant Ice Pack (2)
* Rapid Clotting agent - activates rapid blood clotting to stop large
  scale bleeding events.
* Sealed sterile Laceration surgi-kit - this is not for me, this is for
  a medical person helping me or someone else. See discussion at the end
  of the document.
* Nitrile gloves (6 pairs)

### Everything Else
* "Biffy Bag" - portable toilet (3) - provides a sanitary way to evacuate
   without adding additional hazards for you are people who might follow along.
* Paper maps of the Bay area - never needs power :-)
* Portable AM/FM radio, vacuum sealed AA batteries (replaced every 3 years)
* Victorinox "Rescue Tool" (knife) - has both window breaker and seatbelt
  cutter, tools that have been required in previous earthquakes.
* Heavy duty garbage bags (3)
* Sunscreen (SPF 50) - replaced every 5 years
* 100% Deet bug repellent (2 oz)
* Tape (1 each silicone and plastic) - generalize repairs to things like
  ponchos and for construction of makeshift coverings and/or shelter.
* 16 oz water bottle
* Assortment of s-biners for clipping things to the pack.


## In the Car

These items are in the car generally and not part of the Go Bag per se but 
may be selected from and brought along if the situation merits it.

* Surplus hoodies/fuzzies - Giveaway light jackets of different weights 
  (can be selected from prior to setting out on foot from the car, always
  available for a cover up when out and about and the conditions are cooler
  than were expected)
* 1 Gallon bottled water - (replaced every 6 months)
* 25' of nylon rope - useful for lashing things to the roof rack.
* Light Blue Hard Hat - originally a souvenir from the Hoover Dam tour,
  it is an OSHA certified hard hat and can protect your head from falling debris.
* Hi visibility vest - Cycling vest with retro-reflective material. Easy to see.
* Bao-Feng Radio - Works on amateur bands as well as the FMRS/GMRS bands
* Sun hat - with back flap to protect neck and shoulders from the sun.
* "Last Year's" hiking boots - As boots are nearing the end of their life they
   become the "backup" boots in the car insuring I will have a comfortable,
   and broken in, pair of hiking boots if I am going to be walking 25 or
   30 miles back home.
* Car tools - car has a set of tools for working on the car (wrenches etc) 
  and some diagnostic equipment (multimeter, OBD2 reader cable)
* 1/2 gallon CARB compliant gas can

##About that Surgi-kit

A lot of people ask why I have a surgical laceration kit in my go-bag
given that I am not qualified to actually use it. My reasoning stems
from what I have seen across many disasters that have occurred all over
the world. In the most likely scenario for the bay area, an earthquake
(like the Loma Prieta quake or the Northridge quake), all these people
are moving around and then boom, everything stops moving. At that instant
in time you have a cross section of people evenly distributed across an
area, then some percentage of them will be health care workers (Nurses,
Doctors, PAs etc). And the hospitals will be far away. There is always a
need to rush medical supplies to the zone because you can't move through
the zone. My thought has been that if you evenly distributed medical
supplies on "ordinary" people, then in a disaster scenario as you
pooled people together you would get medical supplies as well, and if a
small fraction of the people in the pool were medical professionals, they
could get to work right away treating people. But drugs are perishable
and a target for people so I don't keep those in my car, instead I have
a small amount of stuff that is useful for cuts and lacerations. If you
have been to the doctor for a serious cut this is the pack they pull out
of the drawer when you come in. It is pre-sterilized, has a fixed amount
of sutures etc and can treat wounds in the "bigger than first aid kit"
but "less than surgery" space.

Since the chance of injury is low, if I find myself hiking home
from my car after an earthquake and I don't need it, I can give the kit
to the first nurse or doctor I find and they can help someone with it.
